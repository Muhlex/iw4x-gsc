# IW4X GSC Scripts
A collection of small-ish GSC only mods that work in a self-contained manner.
These **do not modify base game files**, which makes them modular and compatible with some other mods.

These scripts are built for **[IW4X](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw4x-client)** and may use engine functions that do not
exist on other clients.

## üì¶ Installation
Drop the mods from the `scripts` folder into `<IW4X>/userraw/scripts`.

It is possible to only include some scripts if you know what you are doing.
However some scripts may rely on the presence of others (especially `_` prefixed ones) to work correctly.

All mods are disabled by default. Refer to their respective documentation to enable them.

> Chat-based commands for administrators and players.

Commands are accessible only if a player's permission level matches or exceeds the one required for the command.
The required permission level per command can be edited inside of `commands.gsc`.
The permission level is set per-player using the [`scr_permissions`](#scr_permissions) dvar.

## üîÑ Advanced Map-Rotation
> Smart randomized map rotation based on playercounts.

Usually, `sv_mapRotation` linearly plays the configured maps and gamemodes.
With the addition of `sv_randomMapRotation` in [IW4X 0.7.0](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw4x-client/releases/tag/v0.7.0)
this can be set to be randomized [(Thanks, @diamante0018!)](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw4x-client/pull/146).
However this will shuffle all maps every time they have all been played through, enabling potential duplicate maps at the end of a cycle.
Also gamemodes can no longer be set per map, as they will be shuffled in-between the maps randomly.
	
For an overengineered solution to this, as well as the option to only consider maps which fit the amount of connected players,
this script module can be used. It uses weights for defining the likelihood of a map being picked. A map's weight goes up over time
and is reset once the map is picked.
Use `sv_mapRotation` to setup map and gamemode combinations as usual, leave the inbuilt dvar
`sv_randomMapRotation` at `0` and refer to the table of related dvars to set up the advanced features:

## üî• Incendiary Grenade
> Special grenade exploding into a pool of fire on impact.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21311428/168055048-c27cc71d-cb77-438a-a27e-bdf66bf115dc.mp4

Useful for clearing out rooms or blocking off chokepoints. Duration and Damage are configurable.
Damage and tagging (slowdown on getting hit) scale with the amount of time the fire pool has been burning, allowing targets to react.
Either dvar `scr_incendiary_replace_offhand` or functions inside of `incendiary.gsc` can be used to give players the grenade.
Fire pools can also be spawned and deleted programatically.

## üé≤ Randomizer Mode

<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21311428/169546431-9ab040fd-d4d0-4b9e-9585-e039821d124e.png" alt="Randomizer next loadout notification">

> Widely configurable random loadouts.

Known as the Sharpshooter gamemode in later CoD games, the Randomizer script can be used to add random class loadouts to any gamemode.
Random loadouts are determined at the beginning of a round and can be rerolled on a timer.
Loadouts can either be synced for everyone or be different per team, per player or per life.
A white-/blacklist system allows precise configuration of the available items.
